Copy and paste your IBM Quantum Experience API token into `token.txt` (see [here](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html#install-access-ibm-q-devices-label) for how this works) but do not upload `token.txt` to this repo.

If you are editing at the same time as someone, don't edit the same cells (otherwise there will be difficult-to-resolve merge conflicts).
